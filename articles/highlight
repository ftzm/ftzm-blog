Syntax Highlighting in Flask Views
Syntax highlighting is just as useful in a blog as in an IDE. Your code will be easier for readers to follow, and it will look more polished to boot.

    It's a very simple feature, barely adding one line of code

It seems that most of today's coding blocks have some form of syntax highlighting built in. I wanted to join in on this trend while making this blog, but found surprisingly few explanations of how to implement it. It's a very simple feature, barely adding one line of code. An example of an implementation in Flask will be shown below.
Necessary Packages

There are two packages necessary to implement syntax highlighting in Python. You should be using pip to install packages.

$ pip install markdown2 pygments

Writing the View

Very easy.

import os
print('thing')
class function(arg):
    @decorator
    def thing_to_do():
other_thing = "more stuff"
